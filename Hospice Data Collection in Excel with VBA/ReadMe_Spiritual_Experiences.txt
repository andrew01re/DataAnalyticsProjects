This worksheet is an ongoing project that started when a nursing student working in hospice and palliative care. Based on a couple small scale study and observations in her own clinical experience, she became interested in end-of-life phenomenon where patients appear to have mystical experiences a few days before death. She asked me to prepare a data collection spreadsheet capable of recording metrics, descriptors, and demographics, and long text strings that she could user for her research.
This spreadsheet uses a combination of macros and manually coded VBA functions to take user-input from a front-end sheet and transform it into a table that can be easily used for future analysis. When the "CreateRecord" button is pressed, all of the data currently in the form is saved as a row in the table. The "Reset" button clears all current input on the front end.
